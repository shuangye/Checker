 Title: Step Location Toggling with RTA While On Ground

 Description:

 In BP2 load 3, Perf SCR 11939 made corrections to the step
 stability logic that applies when an RTA is active.  This logic
 works to keep the step position stable, since RTA speed changes
 tend to make the step move, which impacts the RTA solution, causing
 feedback.  A scenario has been found in which the fix made for
 that SCR is failing, however.  The scenario:
 ENG RATING: TRENT 1000-A FMS OPS: HNP2D-CL11-506G Model: 787-8
 On the ground at KBFI.  ORIGIN: KBFI  DEST: KSFO PERF: Fuel 75,
 ZFW 300, RES 5, FL330, CI 100.  RTE: KBFI.13R.LACKR1.ORTIN,
 Dir To ALDER, J1 to RBL, J126 to SACE, Dir to UPEND, Dir to NORMM,
 KSFO.RNV10L.  Close any discons on LEGS page.  WINDS entered on
 LACKR: FL410 086/80, FL280 086/100, 11000 086/60, 0500 086/15.
 RTA PROGRESS page: RTA FIX = RBL, MAX SPD = .900, T/O Time = 1825
 (15 minute ahead of current time), ETA at RBL prior to Entering RTA
 = 1924.6; RTA at RBL = 1923.0.  Observation: On VNAV RTA CRZ page,
 Step to FL370 is toggling between NONE and at a time displayed 2R
 VSD is displaying the toggling step climb.  This was observed first
 by Boeing (Jay Koszola and Mark Wisted) and reproduced by me using
 build 2099 (BP2 RL5).  The step is toggling between being taken
 30nm or so after top of climb, to not being taken at all.  Also,
 UNABLE RTA is toggling, since when you don't take the step the RTA
 cannot be met.

 Analysis/Solution:

 27-Dec-2013-Akhil J-HTSB- This scr needs to be retarget to load 2
 (BP3_TST_REV_X02) as problem scr is target to load 2.

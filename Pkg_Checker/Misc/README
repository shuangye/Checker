This utility reports the (potential) defects in eReview packages. It can run both in GUI mode and cmd line mode.
Files:
-- ReviewPackageChecker.exe (main program)
-- itextsharp.dll           (depends lib)
-- README.txt

GUI Mode
If you double-click ReviewPackageChecker.exe, or start it from the cmd line without any args, it will run in GUI mode.
It is quite intuitive under GUI mode, just drag any files/folders to the window, and it will do the rest for you. Alternatively, you can also specify the path to the review packages via the text box or "Browse" button.

cmd line Mode
If you run ReviewPackageChecker.exe with at lease one arg, it will start in cmd line mode without GUI. The valid args are:
    ReviewPackageChecker.exe pdf_path output_file_path
    
Known Issues:
*) Sometimes it will report a ***.TRT file not printed to the package, or missing SCR report, which actually did. This is a bug from the third-party lib.
